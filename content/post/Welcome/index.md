This is my first blog, so here goes nothing!

I plan to use this space to share posts covering a variety of topics ranging from reflections on recent research, teaching experiences, travel reflections, and some (hopefully) useful coding and teaching resources. Here is a bit more on what to expect:


### Code & tutorials: 
In my research, I have spent alot of time coding and learning new analyses, mostly in R/Rstudio. In this process, I have learned alot from forums, blogs, and other resources, and I plan to share some of this content (and hope it is useful). 

### Research:
I hope to use this space to reflect on my recent research experiences, and highlight new publications. I may also do some reflections on past field work (with alot of pictures). 

### Travel:
I've had the great privledge and opportunity to travel for both work and fun. The only time pick up my journal is during these trips, mostly so I can remember what I did, what I saw, on which trails I traveled, and where I camped. I plan to share some of these reflections here as well. Since travel has been put on hold for awhile (writing this in May 2020), I may dig up some of these old trips to share.
