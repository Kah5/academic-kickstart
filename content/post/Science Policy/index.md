I just attended the annual meeting for Ecological Society of America (ESA), my first virtual conference! While I am disappointed that I couldn’t see everyone in person and visit Salt Lake City for the first time, virtual ESA 2020 had its benefits. It also had some downsides. 

### The Positives
The virtual format allowed me to  interact with and digest the content of talks more easily. I could pause and look at figures & equations in detail, solving the age-old problem of presenters throwing a bunch of math onto a slide and expecting the audience to digest it in ~15 seconds (mea culpa). The ability to watch talks on my own time also meant that I could take the time I needed to jot down some notes, process, and reflect on the cool science I just heard about. I was also able to ask more questions and with more detail than in-person conferences. Also, if a talk wasn’t what I’d expected, I could get up and leave in the middle, which would be quite rude in-person--I promise I didn’t do this very often! 


### The Negatives
However, virtual conferences come with some disadvantages. In particular, I had a lot of trouble accessing the synchronous live Q & A sessions, and I eventually gave up on this. I think that it will be hard to replace the interactions and networking that happens at in-person conferences, but hopefully we can come up with more creative solutions. I was disappointed that many people submitting only slides for the talks, which (to be honest) I haven’t taken the time to look though many of these yet. I understand that there may be some barriers to recording a talk--listening to my voice on video is one of my least favorite things, and it took a few tries to record--but the videos are more compelling, give way more information than just your slides, and you will reach a wider audience. Also, though the online format really lends itself to asking and answering questions, I was also disappointed at how few questions were asked on many of the talks I viewed. Perhaps some of these downsides can be improved upon, especially for conferences later this year which have more time switch to a virtual format, invest in hosting platforms, and develop new ways for us to interact in a COVID-19 world. 

### Will Covid-19 change conferences for the better?
Shortcomings aside, we should all give major thanks to the organizing committee, who turned ESA into a virtual conference on a short time-frame. Transitioning to all-virtual conferences is certainly a change for most of us, but I hope this experience will make future conferences more accessible to all, less fossil-fuel intensive (by reducing travel), and provide a diversity of ways to interact with other scientists. 

Another upside of virtual conferences is that I now have a recorded research talk to share with the world. If you missed ESA, you can check out my talk here!
