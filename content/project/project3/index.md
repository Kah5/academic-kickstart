How do concurrent changes in CO2, precipitation, and temperature jointly affect tree ring growth at a temperate savanna-forest boundary? Specifically, does rising CO2 and water use efficiency enhance tree growth by reducing drought sensitivity, or do increased temperatures drive growth declines?
 
I developed Bayesian models of tree growth and water use efficiency to predict the joint response to three concurrent drivers of global environmental change: precipitation, temperature, and CO2. I also quantified how biological differences in stand structure (open canopy or closed canopy) can mediate growth and physiological responses to environmental changes.
